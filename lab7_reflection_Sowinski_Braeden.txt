Yes, all of the row counts make sense, there may be some duplicatoin.
For example, when we are getting all student ids, and their enrollments, there may be duplicate enrollment data.
i.e. two students are enrolled in the same course_offering. However, we since we are showing the student_id we are able to tell them apart.

I dont think distinct would change the result in the example above, there is student x enrolled in class A, and student y enrolled in class A too. Those are already distinct.

I think for the most part I am selecting the minimul necessary columns, only showing relavent related information.

Unless asked to show all data of a table.
